# Decksnap node

The following project was created using React to creat a front end web application to link in with the back end of the iOS Decksnap application. This appliocation allows users to login register, view their cards and play the game. The game can be played between users using the iOS app and users using the react application. The game is a card playing game similar to top trumps. The application connects to a rest api to retreive user data and a websocket for real time game play
